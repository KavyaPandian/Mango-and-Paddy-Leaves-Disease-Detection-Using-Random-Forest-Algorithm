   Accurate and early detection of plant diseases is crucial for ensuring agricultural productivity and reducing economic losses. In this project, we developed an automated system for Paddy and Mango leaf disease detection using machine learning techniques. The approach addresses key challenges in traditional disease identification methods, which often rely on manual inspection and are prone to errors. A robust dataset containing images of healthy and diseased leaves across five distinct conditions for each crop was collected and preprocessed using noise reduction, resizing, and background segmentation techniques. Feature extraction methods, including texture analysis through Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and color histogram analysis, were employed to capture essential leaf characteristics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, enhancing computational efficiency while preserving critical features. The refined feature set was classified using a Random Forest algorithm, chosen for its ensemble learning capabilities and resistance to overfitting. Extensive evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score demonstrated that the model achieved high performance, particularly in distinguishing subtle disease symptoms. The system was deployed through a lightweight, web-based interface, allowing users to upload leaf images and receive real-time disease predictions. By combining machine learning with accessible technology, this project offers a practical, scalable solution for early plant disease detection, with potential applications in supporting farmers and improving agricultural management strategies.
